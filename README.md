# Evo-Doll Simulator

Welcome to Evo-Doll Simulator! What started as a 2D ragdoll fighting game using neural networks and genetic algorithms quickly morphed into a hilarious alko-party simulator. Created from scratch in just five days, this project showcases the unpredictable and delightful outcomes of experimental coding.

## Overview

Evo-Doll Simulator is a 2D simulation game where ragdolls engage in chaotic party behavior, driven by neural networks and genetic algorithms. The project evolved rapidly, resulting in a unique and entertaining experience that will test the limits of your CPU and GPU.

## Features

- **Ragdoll Physics**: Realistic ragdoll physics to ensure entertaining and unpredictable interactions.
- **Neural Networks**: Each ragdoll is controlled by a neural network, adding a layer of complexity and realism to their actions.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: The ragdolls learn and adapt over time, creating ever-evolving party scenarios.
- **CPU/GPU Intensive**: Be prepared for heavy usage of your system's resources as the simulation runs.

## Future Plans

While Evo-Doll Simulator was created in a short timeframe, there are plans for potential future improvements:

- **Enhanced Neural Networks**: Further training and optimization of the neural networks for more realistic behaviors.
- **Critic System**: Implementing a critic to evaluate and improve each ragdoll's performance individually.
- **Additional Features**: Expanding the simulation with new environments, interactions, and behaviors.
